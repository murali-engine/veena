# Veena example parity

This is the implementation and visual-comparison ledger for the 51 Rust examples in `/Users/ravishankar/personal-work/animation/veena/examples`. It is not the product roadmap; current priorities are in [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md). Manim is the model the examples ultimately derive from.

Current implementation coverage: **all 51 Veena example lessons are represented by runnable Veena scenes.** Ten older linear-algebra ports were deliberately consolidated into five stronger animated stories, and the separate GLB/glTF demonstrations became one format-comparison scene, leaving 45 scene scripts for the 51 reference lessons. Most remaining one-to-one ports still need direct rendered comparison, so their parity cells remain blank even though their scene scripts exist.

This count measures the Rust `examples/` directory only. It does not mean that every public Rust engine or collection API has a reusable JavaScript counterpart. The separate source-level audit in [`feature-parity.md`](./feature-parity.md#rust-capability-audit-29-september-2026) tracks facilities not exercised by the 51 examples, including lifecycle operations, callbacks, morphing, native typesetting resources, procedural primitives, and typed AI trace/agent-flow models. Scene-authored capture sets are now implemented separately.

Capability status stays in [`feature-parity.md`](./feature-parity.md). An example is done only when it meets that ledger's completion rule: a documented API, deterministic tests, a runnable Veena scene, a comparison with the Veena example, and any intentional web difference written down. Checking a box here means all five are true. A blank box means “parity not yet proven,” not necessarily “unimplemented.”

Shared capabilities belong in Veena's reusable layers rather than being rebuilt inside one example. Browser-native substitutions are allowed, but the visible or behavioral difference must be recorded.

## Capability groups

1. Primitive scenes the engine can already express, plus the small holes those scenes still have: a named color palette, dashed strokes, and `indicate()`.
2. Transparent PNG export, for the logo mark.
3. Number plane, axes, and vector arrows, then the graph and linear-algebra scenes.
4. An updater and a traced path, then particles, streamlines, and force fields.
5. Math text, tables, and code blocks. `MathText` is browser MathML; `LatexMorph` uses native LaTeX plus dvisvgm outlines at bundle time. Typst remains browser-emulated. Code blocks are browser text. All animation stays a function of scene time.
6. glTF props, 3D axes, curves, and surfaces, on the scene camera that already exists.
7. Child scenes (`SceneView`): a second timeline with its own camera and clock.
8. Teaching composites: tensors, networks, attention, openings, chat input, and stepwise stories.

## 1. Primitive scenes

Capabilities exercised: timeline, layout, shapes, labels, lines, arrows, paths, typewrite, stroke draw, groups, stacks, portrait frames, preview, and MP4.

| Parity | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | `hello_shapes` | Scene script now follows Veena: palette colors, labels, footer, and shape draw. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `layout_and_groups` | Scene script now follows Veena: helpers place labels and the cluster, then each object moves from a messy start. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `motion_basics` | Scene script now follows Veena. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `portrait_video` | Scene script now follows Veena on the 9:16 frame. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `style_and_paths` | Scene script follows Veena, including fills, strokes, dashes, arrows, and a world-space path. It also replaces the earlier smaller `text-and-paths` demo. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `text_animation` | Scene script now follows Veena, including typewriter, centered reveal, indicate, and undraw. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| intentional difference | `veena-logo-animation` | The earlier Rust/Lissajous logo has been retired. The example plays `VeenaLogoSwell`: the settled three-oval mark springs up from its baseline with the phrase. `VeenaLogoSequence` remains the one-to-three-to-one brand gesture. |

Shared capabilities exercised by this group:

- Named colors (`palette.RED_B`, `palette.GOLD_C`, and the rest of the fixed Veena palette). Present.
- Dashed strokes. Present on lines and paths.
- `indicate()`. Present: a scale and color pulse that rests at both ends.

## 2. Still image export

| Parity | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| intentional difference | `veena-logo-image` | One run exports the canonical three-oval logo twice on square canvases: once with the supplied background color and once with an alpha background. |

## 3. Plane, axes, and vectors

Shared piece: a number plane, 2D axes, and a vector arrow. Plots and linear-algebra panels build on that, not the other way around.

A curated suite now lives in `examples/maths/linear-algebra/`. Its five timeline-native scenes replace ten static ports while preserving their instructional coverage and reusable APIs.

| Parity | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | `graphs_2d` | Scene script follows Veena on `NumberPlane`, `Axes`, a sampled sine, scatter marks, and a legend. `VectorArrow` is shared with the ported linear-algebra scenes. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| ✓ | `maths/linear-algebra/01-vectors-and-basis` | Consolidates vectors, scalar/linear combinations, span, and basis change into one continuously animated coordinate story. |
| ✓ | `maths/linear-algebra/02-dot-product-projection` | Replaces the static dot-product scene with a moving vector, live projection, residual, angle, cosine, sign, and alignment meter. |
| ✓ | `maths/linear-algebra/03-matrix-as-linear-map` | Consolidates matrix-vector multiplication, transformed grids, transformed basis columns, and the weighted-column identity `Ax = x₁Ae₁ + x₂Ae₂`. |
| ✓ | `maths/linear-algebra/04-determinant-area` | Animates positive area scaling, orientation reversal, and singular collapse on one continuous map. |
| ✓ | `maths/linear-algebra/05-transform-order` | Consolidates composition and the former child-scene comparison into synchronized side-by-side non-commuting transformations. |

## 4. Updaters and traced paths

Shared piece: a value that is a function of scene time, and a path that grows from a moving point. No wall clock.

| Parity | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | `traced_paths` | Scene script now follows Veena: the wheel, the dot, and the cycloid. The trace is rebuilt from the point at scene time, sampled every 1/60s, so a seek matches a forward play. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `particles` | Scene script now follows Veena: one seeded belt whose phase is `1.05` times elapsed scene time. The hash uses JavaScript sine, so a dot is not bit-identical to Veena's 32-bit sine. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `streamlines` | Scene script now follows Veena: fourteen seeds grow from 1 step to 170 with an in-out quad. The growth is a function of scene time. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| intentional difference | `force_fields` | The arrows follow the two moving charges as a function of scene time. The unexplained fixed gold plus-mark trail from the earlier port was deliberately removed. Not checked until the remaining rendered field is compared. |

## 5. Math text, tables, and code

| Parity | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | `tables` | Scene script now follows Veena: the grid draws, then the cells type on, then the table unwrites. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `code_blocks` | Scene script now follows Veena: a dark Rust window, then a light TOML window. Coloring is browser text for those two languages, not a Typst highlighter. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `latex_and_typst` | Static comparisons use MathML; the final sequence now uses native LaTeX outlines with exact-glyph matching and cubic Bézier shape interpolation. Typst is still browser-emulated. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `equation_and_matrix_animation` | Scene script now follows Veena: keyed terms slide from `x + 2 = 5` to `x = 5 - 2`, then the matrix focuses a row, a column, and the diagonal. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `fourier_formula_trace` | Scene script follows the epicycle trace. `FormulaOutline` samples the authentic compiled `\pi` Bézier contour at uniform arc-length intervals; the final frame and camera restoration were render-checked. |

## 6. 3D objects on the existing camera

These examples exercise the shared scene camera with Three.js geometry and assets.

| Parity | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | `curves_3d` | Scene script now follows Veena: perspective camera, 3D axes, and a parametric curve that draws on with a pulse. Lines are WebGL lines, so thickness is in pixels rather than world units. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `surfaces_3d` | Scene script now follows Veena: the hill writes in by parameter row, colored by height. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `wireframe_surfaces` | Scene script now follows Veena: the saddle grid draws across, then down. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `textured_surface` | Scene script follows Veena: a wire sphere writes in, then a textured sphere using the same bundled `earthmap1k.jpg` replaces it. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `prop3d-formats` | One side-by-side scene now covers both reference lessons: the GLB pyramid and glTF-plus-BIN apple are parsed before the first frame and animated in the same 3D world. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `model_inspector` | Scene script follows the default preview: the apple is fitted to a span of 4.2 and turns at 24 degrees per second for one revolution. Pointer orbit, wheel zoom, and the keyboard modes are not in the recording, and the footer says so. Captions use those same fractions of the fixed frame. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `map_projection_morph` | Scene script follows Veena: five projection blends, each a function of scene time, over the same bundled Earth surface image. The graticule and caption read that same time. Graticule lines are WebGL lines, so thickness is in pixels. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |

## 7. Child scenes

Shared piece: a scene inside a scene, with its own clock, camera, and loop. The parent samples both deterministically.

| Parity | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | `scene_view` | Scene script now follows Veena: the network is a child scene looping every 3.5 seconds while the parent moves that inset aside and explains it. The child picture is transparent, so the view's own plate shows behind it. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `opening_scene_view` | Ported with the shared `Opening` composite inside a once-playing `SceneView`, followed by the observe/reason/explain parent sequence and signal pulses. Rendered successfully; direct Veena comparison remains. |

## 8. Teaching composites

These are domain-level components built on the core scene, timeline, layout, and rendering layers.

| Parity | Example | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | `neural_networks` | Intentionally exceeds the Rust scene: a computed 2-3-1 forward pass animates semantic input, ReLU, and sigmoid snapshots. Signed weight colors, weight magnitude, displayed values, and unique-edge signal propagation all come from the reusable neural-network component. Render-checked on 30 September 2026. |
| | `transformer_attention` | Scene script now follows Veena: a token row, an attention heatmap, and a pre-norm block. The gold and teal pulses each play once. Stage emphasis is a function of scene time, not a stored focus flag. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `context_window` | Scene script now follows Veena: five role-tagged blocks inside one 8192-token budget. History keeps 2700 of 4900 tokens, trimmed from the start. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `kv_cache` | Scene script now follows Veena: key and value rows fill one token at a time, and the newest row is outlined. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `normalization` | Scene script now follows Veena: each token row shows its residual values beside that row's layer-norm, with the row's mean and divisor. Sums are rounded to 32 bits. The divisor is the square root of variance plus 1e-5, not of the variance alone. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `next_token_distribution` | Scene script now follows Veena: temperature 0.85, then the top 5, then top-p 0.90, then one draw at 0.61. Three tokens remain and the draw selects blue. Exponentials are 64-bit and still pick that same token. The entropy bar is centered on its placed point, with empty space below the label so the bar stays there. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `tensor_semantics` | Scene script now follows Veena: QK^T, scale by sqrt(2), a causal mask of -4, then softmax. The "reads" row stays highlighted. Products are rounded to 32 bits. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `tensor_operations` | Scene script now follows Veena: a feature bias stored out of order is added by element id, the result splits in two, then those halves merge and reshape onto explicit axes. The value change is a smoothstep of scene time. Products and sums are 32-bit. Label widths are character estimates. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `tensor_slicing` | Scene script now follows Veena: batch 0, head 0, then head 1, as token by feature. The head change is a smoothstep of scene time. Activations use JavaScript sine; the printed cells match the 32-bit scene. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `self_attention_lesson` | Scene script now follows Veena: the trace file drives embeddings, Q, K, and V, then scale, a causal mask of -20, softmax, the residual add, and one categorical draw. The last draw at 0.78 selects clearly. Products are 32-bit. Exponentials are 64-bit and still select that token. Label widths are character estimates. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `stepwise_storytelling` | Scene script now follows Veena through the fluent `step`, `connect`, `route`, and `sequence` builder: four steps reveal in order, the feedback hop drops below the row, then a teal signal replays the journey including that hop. Reveal progress is eased, and each step smoothsteps inside its own share. Node widths are character estimates. The diagram is anchored on the first step, with empty space on the other sides, because Veena places an object by its center. Representative Veena frames have been checked; direct side-by-side comparison with Veena remains. |
| | `chat_input_box` | Scene script now follows Veena: the user bubble and send button fade in, then the prompt types; the reply bubble follows. Tips hang below the box. The box stays on its placed point, with empty space above matching the tip. Text positions use a character-width estimate. Not checked until the rendered frames are compared. |
| | `kavriq_opening` | Ported through the reusable `Opening` builder: perspective landing, procedural marble faces, deterministic glyph particles, dissolve, and tagline reveal. Rendered successfully; direct Veena comparison remains. |
