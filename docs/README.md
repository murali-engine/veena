# Veena documentation site

This Docusaurus workspace hosts the Veena landing page and documentation.

| Surface | Public path | Source | Version command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Landing page | `/` | `src/pages/` | — |
| Veena docs | `/docs/` | `docs/` | `docs:version` |

The site is exclusively for Veena. The navbar and landing page link to
[Murali](https://muraliengine.com/), the Rust-powered engine, for specialised projects that need
native control.

Run the site from the repository root:

```bash
npm run docs:start
npm run docs:build
npm run docs:serve
```

## Deployment

The documentation is deployed to `https://veenaengine.com` by
`.github/workflows/documentation.yml` whenever documentation or its workflow changes on `main`.
The workflow can also be started manually from GitHub Actions. It builds the site with the root
workspace lockfile and deploys `docs/build` through GitHub Pages.

`static/CNAME` places `veenaengine.com` in the generated Pages artifact. Before enabling this
repository's deployment, remove the same custom domain from the former Rust documentation Pages
site and change this repository's Pages source to **GitHub Actions**. GitHub permits a custom domain
to be attached to only one Pages site at a time, so coordinate those changes closely.

## Creating documentation versions

Run these commands from the repository root.

Create a documentation snapshot:

```bash
npm --workspace @veena/docs run docusaurus -- docs:version <version>
```

For example:

```bash
npm --workspace @veena/docs run docusaurus -- docs:version 0.0.2
```

Current documentation is served at `/docs/`. Version snapshots remain available from
the version selector—for example, the test snapshot is served at `/docs/0.0.1/`.
